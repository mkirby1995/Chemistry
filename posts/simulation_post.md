Welcome to an interactive exploration of the Sabatier reaction—an essential process for future Mars missions. This simulation is designed to provide a hands-on understanding of how methane (CH₄) and water (H₂O) are produced from carbon dioxide (CO₂) and hydrogen (H₂) under Martian conditions. It offers valuable insights into how in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) can support sustainable human presence on the Red Planet.

## Context and Importance of the Sabatier Reaction

The Sabatier reaction plays a critical role in reducing the logistical challenges of Mars exploration. By leveraging the abundance of CO₂ in the Martian atmosphere, this process enables the production of:

- **Methane (CH₄):** A vital component for rocket fuel.
- **Water (H₂O):** Essential for life support and further processing into oxygen and hydrogen.

By implementing ISRU strategies like this, mission planners can minimize the need to transport large quantities of consumables from Earth, drastically reducing costs and mission complexity.

## Components of the Simulation

This simulation models key systems and factors involved in the Sabatier process, creating a realistic representation of operations on Mars:

1. **Atmosphere Intake System:** Captures CO₂ using a scroll pump, modeling power requirements and timing.
2. **Sabatier Reactor:** Converts CO₂ and H₂ into CH₄ and H₂O through exothermic catalytic reactions.
3. **Electrolysis Reactor:** Splits H₂O into H₂ (recycled for the Sabatier process) and O₂ (a valuable byproduct for life support or propulsion).
4. **Power Systems:** Simulates energy generation from solar panels and nuclear sources, complemented by battery storage to handle Martian day-night cycles.
5. **Environmental Factors:** Incorporates temperature and pressure variations to reflect the challenging Martian environment.
