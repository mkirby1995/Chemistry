Welcome to our interactive simulation of a Sabatier reactor designed for Martian conditions! This simulation models the production of methane (CH₄) and water (H₂O) from carbon dioxide (CO₂) and hydrogen (H₂) using the Sabatier reaction.

## About the Simulation

The Sabatier reaction is a critical process for sustainable life support and fuel generation on Mars. By converting the abundant CO₂ in the Martian atmosphere into methane and water, future missions can generate rocket fuel and life support consumables _in situ_, reducing the need to transport these resources from Earth.

Our simulation incorporates various components:

- **Atmosphere Intake System**: Captures CO₂ from the Martian atmosphere.
- **Sabatier Reactor**: Converts CO₂ and H₂ into CH₄ and H₂O.
- **Electrolysis Reactor**: Splits water into H₂ and O₂, recycling hydrogen and producing oxygen.
- **Power Systems**: Manages power generation from solar and nuclear sources, as well as battery storage.
- **Environmental Factors**: Models Martian temperature and pressure cycles over time.

## Using the Dashboard

You can interact with the simulation through our dashboard:

1. **Simulation Controls**:
   - **Simulation Speed**: Adjust how fast the simulation progresses.
   - **Simulation Duration**: Set the duration of the simulation in Martian years.
   - **Run/Pause**: Start or pause the simulation at any time.

2. **Visualizations**:
   - Select different visualizations to explore various aspects of the simulation, such as storage tank levels, power demand, and efficiency metrics.

3. **Logs Viewer**:
   - View real-time logs to monitor the simulation's progress and internal operations.

## How It Works

- **Play/Pause Controls**: Start or pause the simulation to explore data at your own pace.
- **Speed Control**: Increase or decrease the simulation speed to fast-forward or slow down the simulation.
- **Duration Control**: Simulate different time spans to observe long-term trends or short-term behaviors.
- **Visualization Options**: Switch between charts to focus on specific data, such as:
  - Storage tank levels of CO₂, H₂, CH₄, H₂O, and O₂.
  - Power demand and generation over time.
  - Efficiency metrics of production processes.
  - Environmental conditions like temperature and pressure.

## Why This Matters

Understanding the intricacies of in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) is vital for future Mars missions. By simulating these processes, we can:

- Optimize reactor designs.
- Predict resource needs and storage capacities.
- Develop robust systems resilient to Martian environmental challenges.
